# Mimblewimble in Python

We are building the first Python-based implementation of the Mimblewimble protocol for the [grin cryptocurrency](https://grin.mw/). At the moment it is at the most early stage of development. Heavily based on the [grin++ wallet](https://github.com/GrinPlusPlus/GrinPlusPlus).

## Expected features

* Managing blocks
* Managing transactions

## Use-cases

* Implement python-based wallets and nodes for [grin](https://grin.mw/)
* [Research](https://forum.grin.mw/c/research/11) new protocols, quickly drafting ideas and testing them
* Have [grin](https://grin.mw/) codebase that anyone can easily understand and translate to other languages

## Useful docs

1. Regarding serialization/deserialization [p2p protocol document](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/P2P-Protocol#compactblockbody)

## Support

This project is NOT financed from the grin fund neither grin community fund. I deliverately did not request funding because of the following reasons:

1. I am not certain how much time I will be able to dedicate to it
2. I want this project to earn trust from the community, not have it guaranteed upfront
